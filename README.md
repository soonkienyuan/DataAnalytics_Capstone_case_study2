Google Data Analytics Capstone : How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play


## Datasets
This case study utilises FitBit Fitness Tracker Data that is publicly accessible on Kaggle. The dataset was collected based on the responses of thirty individuals who participated in a distributed survey conducted by Amazon Mechanical Turk between December 3 and December 5, 2016. 

Although there are 18 datasets, I was only able to use 6 of them for this case study.
