Urka Sren, Bellabeat's founder and CCO, thinks smart device fitness data could help the company grow. I'm studying smart device data for a Bellabeat product to learn how consumers use them. The insights will shape marketing strategy. I'll give Bellabeat's management my findings and recommendations.

Although there are 18 datasets, I was only able to use 5 of them for this case study.
